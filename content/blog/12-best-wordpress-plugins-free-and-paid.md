With the right suite of plugins incorporated into your backend, you can dramatically (and instantaneously) improve the functionality, aesthetics, and efficiency of your site both for yourself and your viewers.

However, with the myriad of options available to the average webmaster, the challenge of finding the best WordPress plugins can feel all but impossible.

After all, it only takes one janky line of code or installation gone awry to transform your formerly beautiful and sleek website into a jumbled mess of nonsensical code, wonky themes, and broken functionality.

Not to worry.

We’ve done all of the heavy lifting for you, installing and reviewing countless WordPress plugins to determine once and for all which ones are worth your time and which ones aren’t.

**So, without any further ado here is our list of the top 12 WordPress plugins for 2020.**

# 1. Contact Form 7

If you need a plugin that will allow you to seamlessly create and manage multiple contact forms, use reCaptcha verification, and ensure that all spammy submissions are filtered out with Askimet (more on them in a second), then [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) is the last WordPress plugin you’ll ever need.
