A website integration is, simply put, making a connection between your website and another website or web service. This can be as simple as a link to one of your social media profiles or as complex as a full API (Application Programming Interface) integration to display the latest 5-star client reviews on your own site.

In today’s internet, a handful of companies have emerged to provide best-in-class web services. Some are so popular that their company name is synonymous with the service they provide. A prime example; do you search for something, or do you “Google” it? With a website integration, you can take a little piece of a company’s technology and, perhaps just as powerfully, a little piece of their brand recognition and enhance your own website with it. You will be adding functionality and instant credibility.

In this article we will highlight, in no particular order, the 10 best integrations for lawyer websites. We will explain how they can be of help to your legal business, and how to integrate them on your website.

## Google Analytics for Lawyer Websites

### What is Google Analytics?

[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is the most widely used analytics service on the internet. It tracks traffic on your website and provides detailed reports on its usage.

### How can Google Analytics help my legal business?

Google Analytics gives you the opportunity to learn about your current and potential clients before they even contact you. Understanding how visitors are interacting with your website allows you to evaluate its effectiveness and make informed decisions that will help you attract your ideal clients.

### How do I integrate Google Analytics into my website?

Google Analytics is quite simple to set up on your website. It involves [setting up a free Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) and adding a [JavaScript tracking code](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080) to all pages of your website. Every Smit Patel's website launches with Google Analytics tracking set up and in place.

### Why we love this integration

The best part about Google Analytics is watching the trendline of site visitors increase over time. Our customers use this as a clear indicator that our smart SEO strategy is working. When it comes to marketing your law practice, there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing a positive trendline!


## Google Reviews for Lawyer Websites

### What is Google Reviews?

Google Reviews is a feature of Google that allows users to write a public review of a business. These reviews, along with an average score out of 5, are displayed in Google Search results, on Google Maps, and on other Google services.

### How can Google Reviews help my legal business?

Google Reviews are one of the most important tools in existence when it comes to establishing and maintaining your reputation online. They are the basis upon which many prospective clients will form their initial opinions of your business and they could very well be the deciding factor in a client choosing you over your peers.

Asking your clients to write a Google Review is quick and easy and replying to those reviews yourself shows that you value your clients’ input and that you are engaged in your online reputation.

### How do I integrate Google Reviews into my website?

At the time of writing this article, adding Google Reviews directly on your website is a complex integration. Google does not have any ready-made widgets for embedding reviews, so developers must use the [Google My Business API](https://developers.google.com/my-business) or the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro) to build custom integration solutions. I have developed a custom solution for use on your websites that will allow you to harness the power of Google Reviews and start building your online reputation today.

### Why we love this integration

Lawyer reviews are impactful because they are typically characterized by relief, elation, and gratitude. We love how easy our Google Reviews integration makes it for lawyers to make sure they never miss sharing such valuable testimonials where it matters most: on their website.


## Facebook for Lawyer Websites

### What is Facebook?

Facebook is the world’s largest online social network website. It is an online community made up of over 2.4 billion users and over 140 million businesses who interact with each other by sharing content, comments, and opinions.

### How can Facebook help my legal business?

With over 2 billion users, it is quite likely that your ideal prospective clients are on Facebook and having a Facebook Page for your business establishes you in that community. It allows people to connect with your business and encourages lasting relationships to be formed. Facebook also allows you to run targeted Facebook ads to help you and your ideal clients find one another.

### How do I integrate Facebook into my website?

Facebook offers a number of integration options to bring the power of Facebook to your website. An integration can be as simple as a link from your website to the Facebook Page for your business or [adding a “share” button](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button/) that makes it easy for visitors to share your content on Facebook.

Facebook also offers [The Facebook pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel), a piece of JavaScript tracking code that works hand-in-hand with Facebook ads, allowing you to measure and optimize your ad campaigns.

### Why we love this integration

A lot of our customers have had great success with Facebook Ads, so we’re always happy to set up the Facebook pixel when requested. This can be a very successful marketing channel for personal injury, employment law, and family legal services.


## LinkedIn for Lawyer Websites

### What is LinkedIn?

[LinkedIn](https://about.linkedin.com/) is the world’s largest professional social network. It is an online community made up of over 600 million users in over 200 countries and territories. LinkedIn works to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.

### How can LinkedIn help my legal business?

LinkedIn has, for a number of years, been the most used social network by lawyers. Being a professionally focused social network, its users are there to engage in business activities. This means reading relevant business news, showcasing work experiences, building reputations, and connecting with clients and prospective clients. Building a robust profile on LinkedIn will help establish you as a credible member of the online professional community.

### How do I integrate LinkedIn into my website?

Often a LinkedIn integration simply consists of linking to your LinkedIn profile from your website. This makes it easy for visitors to find your LinkedIn profile and see that you are active in that community. LinkedIn also offers an easy-to-add [plugin for adding a “share” button](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/plugins/share-plugin) to your website that makes it easy for visitors to share your content on LinkedIn.

### Why we love this integration

Since lawyers will often visit each other’s websites, we love including a link to a personal LinkedIn page when we can. Our customers never miss any opportunities to network and they’re able to form relationships with other lawyers for mutual benefit right from their website.


## Avvo for Lawyer Websites

### What is Avvo?

[Avvo](https://www.avvo.com/about_avvo) is a leading online legal marketplace. It features profiles for 97% of all US lawyers consisting of client reviews, disciplinary actions, peer endorsements, and answers to user-provided legal questions.

### How can Avvo help my legal business?

Avvo seeks to connect clients with the right lawyer for them and you want to attract the ideal clients for your practice, so being an active participant in the Avvo community can help you make those valuable connections. Additionally, if you have not already taken charge of your Avvo profile, there is a good chance that it already exists and is waiting for you to claim and leverage it.

Providing answers to legal questions posted to the Avvo website or sharing legal guides on topics relating to your niche practice areas can help distinguish you as a helpful voice and an expert in your field.

### How do I integrate Avvo into my website?

Avvo offers a number of integrations that can easily be added to your website. The most popular of these are [Avvo badges](https://www.avvo.com/partner_with_us/syndication) which are eye-catching graphic badges that highlight your Avvo achievements and direct visitors to your Avvo profile. Avvo awards badges for high ratings, for clients’ choice, and for being a top contributor.

Avvo also offers integrations that allow you to embed your [Avvo Answers or Avvo Legal Guides](https://www.avvo.com/partner_with_us/syndication) on to your website. [Avvo also offers an API](https://www.avvo.com/partner_with_us/api) allowing developers to build advanced custom integrations to bring Avvo content to your website.

### Why we love this integration

The Avvo badge is widely recognized by the general public, so it’s a great addition to have on a lawyer website. The Avvo Answers integration is great too because it bridges the gap between a potential client feeling unsure about their situation and them having enough confidence to place that first phone call.


## vCard for Lawyer Websites

### What is a vCard?

A vCard, also known as a Virtual Contact File (or VCF) is the internet standard file format for sharing contact information. It is your business card in a file, ready to be easily added as a contact to a client’s mobile phone and computer contact lists.

### How can a vCard help my legal business?

Providing your clients with a vCard that instantly imports your full set of contact information into their contacts list is a simple action with a big “wow” factor. It is like a little bit of magic for the technically uninitiated and an appreciated convenience for the technically proficient. You want your clients to know that working with you will be a positive experience – structured and streamlined – and this is a subtle way to give that impression.

### How do I integrate a vCard into my website?

Integrating a vCard into your website is as simple as making the vCard (.vcf) file downloadable and linking to it alongside your traditional contact info such as your email address and phone number.

Most contact management programs such as Apple Contacts or Microsoft Outlook can export a vCard file from your contacts and there is also a [free online vCard Maker](https://vcardmaker.com/) that you can use.

### Why we love this integration

vCards remain a classic staple for law firms, especially for commercial law firms where networking with each other is so important. We like how easy it is for our customers to share essential contact information on demand.


## MailChimp for Lawyer Websites

### What is MailChimp?

[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is an immensely popular email marketing service designed to make it easy to promote your business via email campaigns. It also provides you analytics data and performance reports on your email campaigns so you can determine what is working and what can be changed to ensure that your message is having the best possible impact.

### How can MailChimp help my legal business?

Once you have an audience, keeping them engaged is important. An email newsletter – even an infrequent one – can keep your clients informed on the trajectory of your practice and on your accomplishments and areas of expertise. Perhaps your clients will learn that you provide a service they didn’t know you provided and will either be in need of that service themselves or will know someone who is. Staying fresh in your clients’ minds will help lead to repeat business and referrals.

### How do I integrate MailChimp into my website?

The most popular way to integrate MailChimp into your website is to [add a newsletter signup form](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/) so that your visitors can subscribe to your mailing list. MailChimp has easy-to-use tools to create the signup form and create the embed code. They also offer GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) enabled forms so that you can be sure you are collecting consent with your signups.

### Why we love this integration

For business lawyers who are interested in retaining clients on an ongoing basis, MailChimp is a great strategy to stay engaged with clients. By sharing useful or interesting pieces of news periodically, potential clients can begin to realize the value of outside general counsel.


## Calendly for Lawyer Websites

### What is Calendly?

[Calendly](https://calendly.com/) is a scheduling software service that allows clients to schedule a meeting in your calendar of availability. It allows you to manage and control your availability so that you can set buffer times between meetings, prevent last-minute meetings, and ensure that you are never double booked.

### How can Calendly help my legal business?

You are busy and keeping track of your schedule takes a lot of time and effort. With Calendly you can prevent the back-and-forth emails and phone calls that can turn scheduling a simple meeting into a full-day distraction. With more time to focus on the important aspects of your business, you will have a clearer path to growth and success. In addition, your clients will appreciate the streamlined approach and your prospective clients, seeing how easy it is to schedule an initial consultation with you, may choose you over your peers due to this simple convenience.

### How do I integrate Calendly into my website?

### Why we love this integration

## Intercom for Lawyer Websites

Intercom can help you to quickly qualify leads using live chat and automated answers resulting in you attracting more of your ideal clients in a modern and efficient way.

### How do I integrate Intercom into my website?

After signing up for an Intercom account, Intercom’s Messenger functionality can be [added to your website via a JavaScript code snippet.](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/167-install-intercom-on-your-website-for-logged-out-visitors) Once the snippet is added you’ll be ready to chat with your website visitors in real-time. It really is that easy! Intercom offers a number of tutorials on helpful topics such as how to convert your website visitors into clients and how to customize the Messenger to match your brand.

### Why we love this integration

Potential clients with sensitive legal issues are not always in a position to talk on the phone, especially if they’re at work or at home with family. Live chat can be a great way for clients to remain discreet, get the information they need, and even set up a consultation without back-and-forth emails.


## LawPay for Lawyer Websites

You will have more time to engage and attract clients and to spend on doing the expert work that gets you paid.
